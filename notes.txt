FOR PROJECT MILESTONE #2: Preliminary code that demonstrates access to cloud database.

How I connected to Database online:
I ran this in gitbash --> pip install mysql-connector-python

Created a free trial 90 day account on Google Cloud
Under Cloud SQL service, created a low cost instance as we have only a couple hundred in credits.

Under authorized networks for this instance, applied my own IP address.

In main.py of this repository, utilized chatgpt and asked to create a connector where I simply applied the credentials.
Added some test SQL code like create a table and query.
